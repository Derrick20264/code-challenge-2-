# Event Guest List Manager

This is a simple web app that allows users to manage a guest list for an event using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Learning Goals
- Build a functioning guest list application
- Use `event.preventDefault()` to stop form from reloading the page
- Dynamically update the DOM with JavaScript
- Practice core front-end skills: forms, event listeners, and DOM manipulation

## Features
- Add a guest’s name via a form input
- Display guest names as a list
- Each guest has a **Remove** button to delete them
- Each guest has a **Toggle RSVP** button to switch between "Attending" and "Not Attending"
- Limit the guest list to 10 guests (alerts if limit is reached)

## Stretch Features (optional)
- Categorize guests (Friend, Family, Colleague) with tags
- Display timestamp of when a guest was added
- Add an **Edit** button to update a guest’s name
- Your own custom feature

## How to Use
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
3. Use the form to add guest names.
4. Click **Toggle RSVP** to change their attendance status.
5. Click **Remove** to delete a guest from the list.
6. Try adding more than 10 guests — you’ll get an alert.
